# RandoSBRCO
### By BeesNation

Adds Randomizer logic that allows for collection of vanilla charms in a given order, as well as ItemChanger costs that prevent those charms
from being collected out of order (with two exceptions; see below).

For use with `charm_select.py` from [SBRCO-Programs](https://github.com/Schyvun/SBRCO-Programs)
by SchyðŸ’™ and Aprillomat. 
After having generated your chosen charm order 
copy the contents of the `base64 config` field 
into the mod's connection menu and select `Enable Logic`.

Press the `Apply Settings` button and the mod will
show you the first 5 charms so you can confirm it worked.
It will also warn you at this point if you have any unsupported settings
enabled such as charm dupes.

The mod also can also add any number of extra grubs to the pool
to make getting Elegy a bit more comfy.

### Known issues

The Fury of the Fallen and Mark of Pride chests do not currently have
ItemChanger costs applied, and therefore these two charms can still be
picked up out of order.
